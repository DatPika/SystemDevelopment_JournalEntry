System Development journal entry script

Journal entries have common elements, such as current date formats, a certain number of work sections, location where the work section was done, etc. Instead of manually copy and pasting a previous entry and then modifying all the information, this could be done automatically through a script.

Note: this script uses a formula from the website "https://www.almanac.com/how-find-day-week" to find the day of the week from the date, and with it's current iteration only works until 2099. However, this could be changed to a funky loop that I don't understand to get the date from WMIC
